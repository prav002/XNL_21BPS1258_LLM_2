ðŸ“Œ PHASE 1: INITIAL DESIGN & INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING

Select LLM (GPT-Neo, GPT-J, T5, BLOOM) based on the project goal.
Fine-Tuning Dataset
Collect domain-specific data (e.g., Hugging Face Datasets, custom datasets).
Apply data augmentation (paraphrasing, synonym replacement) for diversity.
Multi-Cloud Infrastructure
Use AWS, GCP, or Azure Free Tier for scalable training.
Choose NVIDIA GPUs (A100, T4, V100) for high performance.
Distributed Training Setup
Implement Horovod / DeepSpeed for multi-GPU efficiency.
Enable Auto-Scaling (KEDA in Kubernetes) to dynamically allocate resources.

ðŸ“Œ PHASE 2: LLM FINE-TUNING FRAMEWORK & DISTRIBUTED TRAINING

Set Up Fine-Tuning Framework
Use Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, PyTorch for model training.
Initialize with pre-trained weights to speed up convergence.
